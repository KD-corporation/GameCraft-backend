## Setup of a New Database Without Affecting the Previous One (runs in Docker)

This document explains how to add a **new Postgres database for games** inside Docker without affecting the existing **main Postgres + Prisma setup**.

---

## Project Structure

```
backend/
├── prisma/                 # existing main Prisma setup (main DB)
├── prisma\_games/           # NEW Prisma setup for games\_db
│    └── schema.prisma
├── docker-compose.yml      # docker setup for new Postgres
├── go.mod / go.sum         # Go modules

````

---
## Step 1: Docker Setup for Postgres
Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the `backend/` directory:

```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:
  postgres_games:
    image: postgres:15
    container_name: postgres_games
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "5434:5432" # host:container
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: games_user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: games_pass
      POSTGRES_DB: games_db
    volumes:
      - postgres_games_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  postgres_games_data:
````


Run the container:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Verify the container is running:
```bash
docker ps
```

---

## Step 2: Prisma Schema for New Database

Create `backend/prisma_games/schema.prisma`:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://games_user:games_pass@localhost:5434/games_db?schema=public"
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-go"
  output   = "./prisma_games_client" // separate client folder
}

model Game {
  id          Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title       String
  genre       String
  releaseDate DateTime
  developer   String
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

---

## Step 3: Apply the Migration

Run from the `backend/` directory:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --schema=prisma_games/schema.prisma --name init
```

---

## Step 4: Install Prisma Go Client

If Prisma Client for Go is not yet installed:

```bash
go get github.com/steebchen/prisma-client-go
```

---

## Step 5: Generate Prisma Client

Generate the Go client for the new database:

```bash
npx prisma generate --schema=prisma_games/schema.prisma
```

This creates the client inside:

```
backend/prisma_games/prisma_games_client
```

---

## Step 6: Import in Your Go Code

Example import inside controllers:

```go
import (
    db "gamecraft-backend/prisma_games/prisma_games_client"
)
```

You can now connect to and query the new `games_db` database without touching the main database.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Error: `file or directory not found`

Run Prisma commands from the `backend/` directory, not inside `prisma_games/`.

### Error: `port already in use`

Check if another Postgres instance is running on `5434`. Update the port in `docker-compose.yml` if needed.

### Error: `Could not find schema.prisma`

Make sure to pass the schema path explicitly:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --schema=prisma_games/schema.prisma --name init
npx prisma generate --schema=prisma_games/schema.prisma
```

### Error: `docker-compose not found`

Install it with:

```bash
sudo apt install docker-compose
```

or use:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

---

## Summary

* **Existing database**: untouched (main Prisma setup in `backend/prisma/`).
* **New database**: runs in Docker on port `5434`, schema defined in `prisma_games/`.
* **Go client**: generated separately in `prisma_games_client`.
* Both databases can run independently.

```

Do you want me to also add a **Go code snippet** in this README that shows how to insert and fetch from the new `Game` model, so it’s directly usable?
```



Here’s a **clean README.md** file you can use for documenting how to connect and manage your Postgres container (based on the setup we discussed):

---

# PostgreSQL in Docker – Setup & Usage Guide

This guide explains how to connect to and manage a PostgreSQL instance running inside a Docker container.
We assume you already have the container up and running (container ID: `58d592fd188f` in this example).

---

## Prerequisites

* **Docker** must be installed and running on your system.
* A **PostgreSQL container** must already be running.
  Example from our setup:

  * `POSTGRES_USER=games_user`
  * `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=games_pass`
  * `POSTGRES_DB=games_db`

---

## Connecting to the Database

You cannot connect directly from your local machine with `psql` (because of Docker’s isolation).
Instead, you need to **enter the container shell** and use `psql` inside it.

### 1. Enter the container’s shell

Run the following command from your terminal:

```sh
docker exec -it 58d592fd188f /bin/bash
```

Your prompt should change to:

```
root@58d592fd188f:/#
```

---

### 2. Connect to PostgreSQL

Inside the container, connect to the database:

```sh
psql -U games_user -d postgres
```

If successful, your prompt will change to:

```
postgres=>
```

---

## Creating a New Database

1. **Create the database:**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE games;
```

Expected output:

```
CREATE DATABASE
```

2. **Verify the database:**

```sql
\l
```

You should now see the `games` database listed.

3. **Exit psql:**

```sql
\q
```

---

## Connecting Directly to the New Database

Reconnect to the new `games` database:

```sh
psql -U games_user -d games
```

Now your prompt should show:

```
games=>
```

---

## Stopping the Container

When you’re done:

1. Exit the container shell:

```sh
exit
```

2. Stop the running container:

```sh
docker stop 58d592fd188f
```

---

## Notes

* Replace `58d592fd188f` with your actual container ID or name (`games_postgres` if you used `docker-compose`).
* If you want to connect **from another container** (like Prisma or pgAdmin), make sure both are on the same Docker network.

Would you like me to also extend this README to include **how to hook this `games_db` into Prisma (Go client)**, so it’s all in one place for your team?
